What is a doubly linked list?
- doubly linked list is similler to a singly linked list, but instead of one pointers, doubly linked list has two pointers, one that point to the next node, and the other point to the previous node in the linked list.

How to use doubly linked lists?
- first you create a new data type contain the Node data `Node->data`,
	and two pointers, ones that point to the next node `Node->next` and `Node->prev` that point the previous node
- after the linked list have been created, you can begin using it across the project, by creating ptr that point to linked list `char *ptr = *head`

Understand and know how to implement the various operations (deletion, insertion, etc) with doubly linked lists
